X-Development:
 Using the official Vcs-Url to retrive *.el file is not necessary the
 best because it downlads *huge* git source code repository. Better to
 go through Vcs-Browser and link 'raw'
 .
 rm git-blame.el
 wget -O 'git.el http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/plain/contrib/emacs/git-blame.el?id=HEAD'
Description: Minor mode for incremental Git blame (official Git contrib code)
 To see which parts of a file has been changed, uer can use call "git
 blame" from command line. The `M-x git-blame' provides same from from
 and can be accessed from the status buffer by pressing key `?'
 (git--status-view-blame).
 .
 By turning on `M-x git-blame-mode' while viewing a file, the editor
 buffer will be updated by setting the background of individual lines
 to a color that reflects which commit it comes from. And when you move
 around the buffer, a one-line summary will be shown in the echo area.
 .
 This is the official Git interface as distributed with the Git Source code.
 Note: 2013-06-03 the code hasn't been touched since 2007.
